# Classification-Cats-vs-Dogs
Building and analyzing various CNN models on a small cats vs dogs dataset.

<b>Dataset from: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prashanthsheri/sheri-cat-dog-clasification)</b>

#
Accuracy vs Epochs and Loss vs Epochs graphs are plotted for each of the models and used to further improve accuracy of the models


Various other techniques are used to achieve a higher accuracy. Some of them are:
1) Transfer Learning and Fine tuning
2) Data augmentation
3) Adding regularization layers in the models
4) Tuning of hyperparameters
5) Tweaking the size and color scheme of the dataset images

#
The final model achieves an accuracy of 77.1% on the testing set
